        <h1>A Beginner’s Guide to Website Speed Optimization</h1>
        

        <article class="introduction">
            <p> Website performance optimization, the focal point of technologically superior website
            designs is the primary factor dictating success for modern online
            businesses. After all, unimpressive website performance kills business
            bottom line when the torture of waiting for slow Web pages to load
            frustrates visitors into seeking alternatives – impatience is a digital virtue! </p> 
            
            <p class="title">And speed sells!</p>
            
            <p>We created the following six chapter
            in-depth speed optimization guide to show you how important it is to
            have a fast loading, snappy website! Countless research papers and
            benchmarks prove that optimizing your sites' speed is one of the most
            affordable and highest ROI providing investments!</p>
            
            <p> In the following guide we'll try to
            explain the technical details while at the same time provide you with
            easy to follow instructions that you can start implementing right away!
            We hope you'll find it valuable (and perhaps share-worthy! :) ). </p>
            
            <p>Lightning-fast page load speed amplifies visitor engagement, retention, and boosts sales. Instantaneous
            website response leads to maximum conversion rates, and every 1 second
            delay in page load decreases customer satisfaction by 16 percent, page
            views by 11 percent and conversion rates by 7 percent according to a
            recent <a href="http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/"> Aberdeen Group research</a> </p>

            <h2>  <span class="counter">Chapter 1</span>
                Introduction to Website Speed Optimization </h2>

            <section>
                <h3>But What Exactly is Page Speed?</h3>
                    <p>The term essentially refers to
                    the speed with which Web pages or media content is downloaded from
                    website hosting servers and displayed onto the requesting Web browser.
                    Page load time is the duration between clicking the link and displaying
                    the entire content from the Web page on the requesting browser.</p>

                    <p>There are three core aspects necessary to understand page speed in context of user experience and website performance:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The view of time taken in delivering the requested material along with the accompanying HTML content to the browser.</li>
                        <li>Browser response to page load requests.</li>
                        <li>The view of end-users as the requested web page renders on 
                            the browser – this is the ultimate empirical measure of page load speed.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Website performance subsequently impacts search engine
                    rankings developed under proprietary and undisclosed algorithms,
                    incorporating key factors including page speed, user experience, website
                    responsiveness and a whole lot of other website performance metrics.</p>

                    <p>The absolute critical principle in
                    maximizing website performance is to focus on page speed optimization
                    from the ground up. Performance optimization plugins, server side
                    scripts and final tweaks have minimal – however noticeable – impact on
                    page speed and load times. Yet, Web developers and online business
                    owners tend to overlook page load times in their website development and
                    design strategies.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                <h3>Slow? How Slow?</h3>
                    <p>Anything slower than the blink of an eye – <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/technology/impatient-web-users-flee-slow-loading-sites.html?pagewanted=all">400 milliseconds</a>
                    Engineers at Google have discovered that the barely perceptible page
                    load time 0.4 seconds is long enough to cause users to search less.</p>

                    <aside class="framed">
                        <figure><img src="optim-images/hourglass.png" alt="hourglass"></figure>
                        <p>Microsoft speed specialist and computer scientist Harry Shum believes 0.25
                        seconds of difference in page load time – faster or slower – is the
                        magic number dictating competitive advantages for online businesses.</p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>The technology has come a long way in
                    improving internet experience. The over-crowded cyberworld of the 1990s
                    was often labeled as the World Wide Wait, but innovations in
                    communication and networking technologies have revolutionized the way
                    digital information is transmitted across the internet. The next
                    generation of online businesses have all the resources they need to
                    deliver content instantaneously, but to leverage and complement these
                    resources, businesses need speed-optimized websites that deliver the
                    best user experience.</p>

                    <p>And what happens when they don’t?</p>

                    <p> <a href="http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/"> 1 in 4 visitors</a>
                    would abandon the website if it takes more than 4 seconds to load. 46
                    percent of users don’t revisit poorly performing websites. Website
                    owners have mere 5 seconds to engage visitors before they consider
                    leaving. 74 percent of users accessing the mobile site would leave if it
                    takes longer than 5 seconds to load. Every one-second delay in page
                    load time could lead to <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/1825005/how-one-second-could-cost-amazon-16-billion-sales">$1.6 billion in annual losses</a> for online merchants as big as Amazon.</p>


                    <p> <a href="http://blog.kissmetrics.com/loading-time/">47 percent</a>
                    of ecommerce customers expect page load times of less than two seconds
                    before they consider leaving – 40 percent of users would abandon the
                    site at the third second of waiting, before a performance analytics tool
                    even captures their presence on the site. The average peak load time
                    for conversions is mere 2 seconds – faster than millions of websites out
                    there. </p>

                    <p>And what happens when they speed up?</p>

                    <aside class="framed">
                        <figure><img src="optim-images/clock.png" alt="clock"></figure>
                        <p> When Mozilla increased page speed by 2.2 seconds, Firefox download figures rose by 15.4 percent, 
                        or <a href="http://loadstorm.com/2014/04/infographic-web-performance-impacts-conversion-rates/">10 million per year</a>! Walmart 
                        <a href="http://www.websitemagazine.com/content/blogs/posts/archive/2014/03/21/5-reasons-visitors-leave-your-website.aspx">saw 2 percent increase in conversion rates for every 1 second</a> improvement in page load times. The numbers don’t lie! </p>
                    </aside>
                </section>

                <section>
                <h3>Acceptable Website Performance – The Neuroscience and Rhythm</h3>

                    <p>Google researchers suggest page load
                    times of less than 100 milliseconds give visitors the illusion of
                    instantaneous website response as the visual Sensory memory processor in
                    our brain works in bursts of 100 milliseconds. The memory store clears
                    itself after 0.1 seconds as photoreceptor cells in the eyes transmit
                    more information to the Occipital lobe.</p>

                    <aside class="framed">
                        <figure><img src="optim-images/eye_see.png" alt="see"></figure>
                        <p> 100 milliseconds. That’s how long the Occipital lobe in our brain stores visual information as a Sensory memory.</p>
                    </aside>

                    <p>1 second of page load time does suffice
                    in maintaining seamless flow of thought – users feel in control of
                    their Web browsing activities, and the mental stress is not aggravated
                    unless the website fails to respond as desired.</p>

                    <p>At 10 seconds of delay, visitor
                    attention is barely kept. The sensation of impatience, frustration and
                    feeling of abandonment is usually strong enough to keep visitors from
                    revisiting such slow websites again.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                <h3>The Pragmatic Psychological Conundrum</h3>
                    <p>However, abandoning a website due to slow page speed is not
                    always the quickest path to access the desired information on the Web.
                    An average user would spend several extra minutes browsing
                    fast-responding but irrelevant websites, instead of waiting a few more
                    seconds for sluggish relevant websites to respond.</p>

                    <p>And considering the sea of resources on
                    the Web, users eventually find the required information on some website
                    or the other. But the eventual losers are online businesses unable to
                    reach their online customers fast enough, despite hosting the exact
                    information and services being sought.</p>

                    <p>Strange enough, visitors would rather
                    spend excessive time browsing for the information elsewhere than waiting
                    a few seconds for the right website to load. The experience is similar
                    to the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/opinion/sunday/why-waiting-in-line-is-torture.html">Houston airport incident</a> 
                    from a few years back that led to a clever solution.</p>

                    <figure><img src="optim-images/airport.jpg" alt="airport"></figure>

                    <p>Passengers at the airport had to take a 1 minute walk to the
                    baggage claim and waited there for 7 minutes to receive their bags. The
                    customer relations center was ultimately inundated with complaints for
                    the slow service.</p>

                    <p>So the airport executives came up with a
                    cunning solution to "resolve’ the issue. They moved the arrival gates
                    far away and routed the luggage to the outermost carousel.</p>

                    <p>Passengers now had to take a 6 minute walk to the baggage claim area where they received their luggage within 2 minutes.
                    The result? Zero complaints. Absolutely no passenger left unsatisfied – except with some tired legs.
                    Similarly, elevators contain mirrors so the passengers keep busy in styling themselves and not thinking about the time spent travelling.</p>

                    <p>This passenger behavior is analogous to that of website visitors in the cyberworld. And the same general
                    principle applies for online businesses as well: It is the objective length of wait that defines the experience of waiting.</p>

                    <p>Now, online businesses can play with human psychology like
                    the Houston airport executives and speed up evolution, but with
                    virtually no specific formula to make website response times bearable
                    for every individual visitor out there. Or they can actually reduce the
                    objective length of wait in delivering the requested content to their
                    online visitors with a fast responding website – whichever is possible
                    when the website is designed to deliver instantaneous response and high
                    quality, seamless user experience.</p>

                    <p> This guide will focus on the latter
                    practice, and will actually help you maximize the potential of your
                    online business by optimizing website performance and thereby enhancing
                    customer satisfaction, retention and loyalty.</p>
